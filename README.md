## Installation

Clone down repo <br>

Once installed run ```bin/breweries```

## Usage
To list a brewery by state, type 'list' at startup.
For individual brewery type 'name'

Listing by state will give you 20 options from the API first page.
Finding by name will use the API to find the inputted brewery with as much accuracy as it will allow.
